<h3 class="projectHeader">React Pokedex</h3>

<p class="projectDesc">
  A small react project using functional components, hooks, and fetch.
  State is currently component level, but I will be implementing the
  context API when the app gets more complicated.
</p>
<p class="projectDesc">
  Right now you can get a random pokemon, or get one from first 150
  "classic" ones. I plan on changing this to make calls for ALL
  Pokemon on app load, and save the state with Context API. This will
  make it easy to build a proper "Pokedex", with the ability to browse
  list-style, or search by name, type, or number.
